This is my book review site for project1.

First, this is my tables.
I created 3 tables.
users table, books table and bookreviews table.
uesrs table is used to store user account.
books table is used to store book data.
bookreviews table has comosite key , ISBN and user_id,  used to uniquely store data of bookreivew .



Let me show how it works.
First , registation page.

users can register their user account in this page.
When the flask application recieves the input data, first, the flask application, returns the input values
with readonly-registationl.html

*GET - 
* registerUser[GET] -> confirmUser -> insertUser




They need to decide their username for this system, and
their firstname and lastname.

When the data is sent to the endpoint, the data is validated whether
the username is unique, and the password is correct.

If the validation is ok, the date is stored in users table.


Here is my page
users can find the their bookreviews and recent book reviews which inculdes their bookreviews .
The logic is After loggin in the book review site
